<p>A few days ago, I wrote about <a href="/Go-action-responses">wrapping Go HTTP handlers</a> so that they can return an abstract Response object rather than dealing with <code>http.ResponseWriter</code>. Today I want to focus on the other end of the request: routing.</p>

<p>What I'm doing here should work with any of the many third party HTTP routers (aka multiplexers) that support URL parameters. I'll be <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/router">using my own</a>, but adapting it to something else should only require a few small changes.</p>

<p>An anti-pattern that I've seen from the Go community is defining specific routes as opposed to using general patterns. I'm by no means dogmatic when it comes to URL patterns, but I do think having consistent and human-readable URLs is beneficial.</p>

<pre data-language=text>
# bad
GET /users
GET /users/:id

# good
GET /:resource
GET /:resource/:id
</pre>

<p>Ultimately, goal is to end up with a map of resources + action names (users show, users favorite list, sessions delete) to handler functions. As a first step, we can manually create this mapping:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
type Action func(out http.ResponseWriter, req *router.Request)

type Resource map[string]Action

var resources = map[string]Resource{
  "users": map[string]http.Handler {
    "show": users.Show,
    "list": users.List,
    "listfavorites": users.ListFavorites,
  }
  "sessions": map[string]http.Handler {
    "create": sessions.Create,
    "delete": sessions.Delete,
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we define generic routes:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
// the exact syntax will depend on which router library you're using
r := router.New(router.Configure())
r.Get("/:resource", ListAction)
r.Get("/:resource/:id", ShowAction)
r.Get("/:resource/:id/:child", ListChildAction)
r.Delete("/:resource/:id", DeleteAction)
</pre>

<p>With these two pieces, we can invoke the proper handler:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func ListAction(out http.ResponseWriter, req *router.Request) {
  resource, exists := resources[req.Param("resource")]
  if exists == false {
    //todo: return not found
    return
  }
  action, exists := resource["list"]
  if exists == false {
    //todo: return not found
    return
  }
  action(out, req)
}</pre>

<p>We can refactor the <code>XYZAction</code> functions and have a single <code>RestDispatch</code> handler:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func ListChildAction(out http.ResponseWriter, req *router.Request) {
  // With the route registered as "/:resource/:id/:child"
  // and a url of /users/48/favorites
  // this will look for the action "listfavorites" of the "users" resource
  RestDispatch(out, req, "list"+req.Param("child"))
}

func RestDispatch(out http.ResponseWriter, req *router.Request, actionName string) {
  resource, exists := resources[req.Param("resource")]
  if exists == false {
    //todo: return not found
    return
  }
  action, exists := resource[actionName]
  if exists == false {
    //todo: return not found
    return
  }
  action(out, req)
}
</pre>

<p>This is probably good enough. However, we can use reflection to improve the manual mapping:

<pre data-language=go>
type Action func(out http.ResponseWriter, req *router.Request)

type Resource map[string]Action

var resources = make(map[string]Resource)

func Start() {
  r := router.New(router.Configure())
  r.Get("/:resource", ListAction)
  r.Get("/:resource/:id", ShowAction)
  r.Get("/:resource/:id/:child", ListChildAction)
  r.Delete("/:resource/:id", DeleteAction)

  registerActions(users.List, users.Show, users.ListFavorites)
  registerActions(sessions.Create, sessions.Delete)
}

// Not thread safe and should be called on init
// 1 - Takes a function
// 2 - Get its full name (github.com/karlseguin/system/users.List)
// 3 - Extract the users.List
// 4 - Register the "list" action for the "users" resources
func RegisterAction(actions ...Action) {
  for _, action := range actions {
    fullName := runtime.FuncForPC(reflect.ValueOf(action).Pointer()).Name()
    relevant := strings.ToLower(fullName[strings.LastIndex(fullName, "/")+1:])
    parts := strings.Split(relevant, ".")
    if len(parts) != 2 {
      panic("action " + fullName + " should be in the form of package.name")
    }

    resourceName, actionName := parts[0], parts[1]
    resource, exists := Resources[resourceName]
    if exists == false {
      resource = make(Resource)
      Resources[resourceName] = resource
    }
    resource[actionName] = action
  }
}
</pre>

<p>It's small improvement that further enforces consistent naming and reduces some of the magic strings. Unfortunately, in Go, it isn't possible to scan a package for functions of a given signature. If it was, we'd be able to automatically detect and register actions.</p>

<p>Finally, this approach doesn't exclude the possibility of having one-off routes for cases that don't fit the general patterns.</p>
