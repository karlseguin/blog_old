<p>Admittedly this should be classified in a <em>duhhh</em> category of knowledge, but...</p>

<p>I recently wrote code that used the useful <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#Value"><code>atomic.Value</code></a> type to support hot reloading a configuration. In doing so, I introduced a goroutine (and memory) leak.</p>

<p>The bug was 100% my fault, and didn't have anything to do with <code>atomic.Value</code> other than the fact that it's the type of issue you'll most likely run into when swapping out values like that. Consider this code:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
type Writer struct {
  queue chan []byte
}

func NewWriter() *Writer {
  w := &Writer{
    queue: make(chan []byte, 10),
  }
  go w.process()
  return w
}

func (w *Writer) Write(message []byte) {
  w.queue <- message
}

func (w *Writer) process() {
  for {
    message := <- w.queue
    // do something with message
  }
}
</pre>

<p>If you create a worker which later falls out of scope, not only will the worker continue to exist, but you'll have lost all references to it:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func main() {
  fmt.Println(runtime.NumGoroutine()) // 4
  test()
  fmt.Println(runtime.NumGoroutine()) // 5
}

func test() {
  NewWriter()
}
</pre>

<p>The solution is to use a channel, add a <code>Stop</code> method and change the <code>process</code> method to:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
type Writer struct {
  queue chan []byte
  stop chan struct{}
}

func (w *Writer) Stop() {
  w.stop <- struct{}{}
}

func (w *Writer) process() {
  for {
    select {
    case message := <-w.queue:
      // do something with message
    case <-w.stop:
      return
    }
  }
}</pre>

<p>Of course, the burden is still on the caller to <code>Stop</code> the worker.</p>

<h3>update</h3>
<p><a href=https://twitter.com/dqminh>@dqminh</a> pointed out that instead of introducing the new <code>stop</code> channel, we could simply have called <code>close</code> on the existing <code>queue</code>. For the above, this is definitely a more elegant solution. However, it's possible that the your worker code won't be channel-bound, say:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func (s *Storage) compact() {
  for {
    time.Sleep(time.Minute)
    //do compaction
  }
}
</pre>

<p>In such cases, you're back to a <code>stop</code> channel in conjunction with the lovely <code>time.After</code>:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func (s *Storage) compact() {
  for {
    select {
    case <-time.After(time.Minute):
      // do compaction
    case <-s.stop:
      return
    }
  }
}
</pre>
