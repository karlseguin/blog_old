<p>I hear the northern howl<br>
calling to me, its lost child.</p>

<p>He who has not seen a fiery forest,<br>
nor smelled a cold morning's crispness,<br>
is no acquaintance to nature's beauty.</p>

<p>After time it may look dreary<br>
as all is frozen and nothing is wild.<br>
Noses will run, sensations go numb, and people growl.</p>

<p>The stillness is an illusion,<br>
the danger an intrusion.<br>
Appreciate the latter<br>
to see through the former.</p>

<p>The naked tree is not preoccupied<br>
with the cost of winter.<br>
It looks only forward: the promise of summer.</p>
