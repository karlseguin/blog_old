title: "Lua's JSON turns empty arrays into empty hashes"
description: "Beware of Lua's JSON handling since it can't always tell whether an empty table should be converted to an empty hash or an empty array"

<p>We recently ran into an issue that took us a while to figure out. Basically, a return value would go from being an empty array:</p>

<pre data-language=javascript>
{
  genres: []
}
</pre>

<p>To an empty hash:</p>

<pre data-language=javascript>
{
  genres: {}
}
</pre>

<p>Not good. Worse, we couldn't figure it out...it was sporadic...impossible. How could an empty array turn into an empty hash?!</p>

<p>Or...Lua uses tables to represent both arrays and dictionaries, so how can it possibly differentiate? From the <a href="http://www.kyne.com.au/~mark/software/lua-cjson-manual.html">docs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  Lua CJSON uses a heuristic to determine whether to encode a Lua table as a JSON array or an object. A Lua table with only positive integer keys of type number will be encoded as a JSON array. All other tables will be encoded as a JSON object.

<p>For us, this meant moving the decoding/encoding out of LUA and passing in the values. Since this is easy to overlook, I hope it saves someone
