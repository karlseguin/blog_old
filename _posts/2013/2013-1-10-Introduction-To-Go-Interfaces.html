<p>Go interfaces define behavior that a type must implement (and expose). A simple example is the <code>io.Writer</code> interface:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
type Writer interface {
  Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
</pre>

<p>There are two sides to this story. First, we can now write a function that expects a <code>io.Writer</code> argument and know that it'll expose a <code>Write</code> method which takes a <code>byte</code> array. You get nice compile-time checks and everything.</p>

<p>On the other side, we can now create our own writers and pass them to whatever function is expecting a <code>Writer</code>. The way Go does this is quite clever. In languages like Java, implementing an interface is explicit. In Go, the implementation is automatically inferred, at compile-time, by the methods attached to our type. In other words, the following is all we need to do to implement the <code>Writer</code> interface:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
type Unicorn struct {

}
func (u *Unicorn) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
  //do something
  return
}
</pre>

<p>Now, an instance of <code>Unicorn</code> is welcomed wherever an <code>io.Writer</code> is expected. No verbosity about it at all.</p>

<p>If we also want it to implement <code>io.Closer</code>, we simply attach a <code>Close</code> method:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func (u *Unicorn) Close() (err error) {
//do something
  return
}
</pre>

<p>It's worth noting that a number of interfaces in Go wrap a single method, which is actually quite convenient</p>
