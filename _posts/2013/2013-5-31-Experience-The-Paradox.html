<p>Knowledge is the gift of experience,<br>
pride its curse.<br>
He who was a humble apprentice<br>
abandons his thirst</p>

<p>What once we sought<br>
now jealously guarded.<br>
All others are not<br />
and should be discarded</p>

<p>Knowledge is endless;<br>
a blow to our pride.<br>
Much easier to hide<br />
behind imagined greatness</p>

<p>Experience, the paradox.<br>
At first they flock<br>
later they mock</p>
