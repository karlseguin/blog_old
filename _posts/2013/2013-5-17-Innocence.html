<p>They say:</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Son, wait 'til you're older<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for then you'll be wiser,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and these things you doubt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll figure out.</em></p>

<p>Age is no gift,<br />
and experience no teacher.<br />
Of course there's a shift<br />
but it's made you no better.</p>

<p>The child is greater<br />
than both mother and father.<br />
All that they've gained<br />
is a belief that they're smarter</p>

<p>They should be ashamed;<br />
blind to such loss.<br />
A wide chasm they've crossed<br />
and innocence lost.</p>
