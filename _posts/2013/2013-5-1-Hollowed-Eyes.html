<p>Hollowed eyes<br />
haunted by my future.<br />
Relief found only in the highs<br />
of a drunken stupor</p>

<p>Past memories petrify<br />
defining a path<br />
which terrifies</p>

<p>How daft<br />
to let mistakes from my past<br />
awaken ghosts from tomorrow<br />
to choke me in sorrow</p>

<p>I am dead.<br />
Life a facade,<br />
for living it I dread.</p>
