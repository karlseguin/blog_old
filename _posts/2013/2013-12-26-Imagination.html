<p>I once knew a boy<br />
who was fearless with joy.<br />
He fought in great wars<br />
amongst elves, dragons and dwarves.<br />
Enemies, neither real nor imaginary,<br />
could deny him victory.</p>

<p>Within his stone tower<br />
safe from all danger<br />
a stirring he spied:<br />
"Evil warlock, today you die!"</p>

<p>At the sound of his signal<br />
his forces sprang from their vigil,<br />
they unleashed their trap,<br />
there'd be no going back.</p>

<p>The warlock was powerful<br />
and his minions loved battle.<br />
Despite their dimwittedness<br />
they laughed at the wastefulness<br />
of securing the rear<br />
against an enemy with no fear.</p>

<p>"Why cut our retreat?"<br />
"It's forward we'll meet!"</p>

<p>The thunder of metal<br />
is the first note of battle.<br />
The symphony of this turmoil<br />
will stain red the soil.</p>

<p>The warlock was cunning<br />
and glimpsed his undoing.<br />
He saw the traps purpose<br />
was to end his darkness.</p>

<p>Ne'er did he flinch<br />
for he was a lich<br />
and lack of escape<br />
emboldened his hate.</p>

<p>He let out a shriek<br />
which pierced like a beak.<br />
Within minutes of starting<br />
the front lines were crumbling.</p>

<p>Our hero stood not idle,<br />
first to grab sword, shield and saddle.<br />
A brief moment was shared<br />
between rider and horse, 'til death were they paired.</p>

<p>To the front with all haste<br />
where darkness lays waste<br />
and light's noble warriors<br />
are surrounded by ogres.</p>

<p>Though the losses are crushing<br />
and the blood is gushing,<br />
man, elf and dwarf hold their ground<br />
for their cause is sound.<br />
But it's hard to keep hope<br />
when so many fell from a single stroke.</p>

<p>With no time to spare<br />
our hero arrives and vengeance he swears.<br />
He charges the enemy,<br />
renewing hope to his army,<br />
and downs five giant ogres<br />
like a child squashing spiders.</p>

<p>Stealth was his first choice<br />
and quick victory to rejoice<br />
but the warlock is far from depleted<br />
and will not be defeated.</p>

<p>Now the battle flows<br />
with thousands of blows.<br />
The fighting goes on,<br />
what started at dusk won't end 'til dawn.</p>

<p>A dwarf and a troll<br />
focused on their goal<br />
of slaying the other<br />
notice the quiet of each owns brother:<br />
Our hero and warlock are engaged!<br />
Both armies look on half-dazed.</p>

<p>The warlock's a master trickster<br />
using poison, minions and blinding powder.<br />
Bur our hero's not naive<br />
and deflects these with ease.</p>

<p>The warlock's not aggrieved<br />
for the game he plays is to deceive.<br />
From the shadow of his weakest thrust<br />
springs forth the real demon like steel from rust.</p>

<p>From all of the watchers was concealed<br />
his next strike: such force, such speed.<br />
But our hero is not naive,<br />
and deflects this blow with, admittedly, far less ease.</p>

<p>The furry was not just the warlock's<br />
our hero did more than throw blocks.<br />
His own power unleashed,<br />
like man turned to beast,<br />
he swung and he slashed,<br />
dodged as he lashed,<br />
invoked spells of light<br />
to extinguish this blight.</p>

<p>The ground beneath compresses,<br />
time feels the stresses.<br />
The forces of immortals collide<br />
and neither shall be denied.<br />
