<p>Like most, I've always appreciated a software package that lets me hot-reload the configuration without having to restart. Nginx immediately comes to mind, as does Postgresql (not for all settings, but most). This is something I've never done; so I was pretty happy when the opportunity presented itself. </p>

<p>I'm not sure how anyone else does this, but it's pretty basic stuff. When you get past the meaningless fact that you're reloading a configuration, it's just about providing concurrent read and write access to a shared object. There are a lot of ways to do that and a lot will depend on your language/framework. In Go, our approach was to use a read/write mutex.</p>

<p>First, our basic configuration structure, a global (to the package) variable and a similar lock:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
import (
  "os"
  "log"
  "sync"
  "syscall"
  "os/signal"
  "io/ioutil"
  "encoding/json"
)

type Config struct {
  Mode string
  CacheSize int
}

var (
  config *Config
  configLock = new(sync.RWMutex)
)
</pre>

<p>Next we need a function that loads our config:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func loadConfig(fail bool){
  file, err := ioutil.ReadFile("config.json")
  if err != nil {
    log.Println("open config: ", err)
    if fail { os.Exit(1) }
  }

  temp := new(Config)
  if err = json.Unmarshal(file, temp); err != nil {
    log.Println("parse config: ", err)
    if fail { os.Exit(1) }
  }
  configLock.Lock()
  config = temp
  configLock.Unlock()
}
</pre>

<p>Whether we exit on failure depends on whether this is the first time loading the configuration or if it's a reload. We use a <code>temp</code> variable to hold our new reference so that we can minimize the duration of our write lock to the simplist possible code.</p>

<p>Next we need is a way to access the current configuration:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func GetConfig() *Config {
  configLock.RLock()
  defer configLock.RUnlock()
  return config
}
</pre>

<p>Finally we need to do an initial load as well as be able to cause a reload. To do this, we listen for a signal:<p>

<pre data-language=go>
// go calls init on start
func init() {
  loadConfig(true)
  s := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
  signal.Notify(s, syscall.SIGUSR2)
  go func() {
    for {
      &lt;-s
      loadConfig(false)
      log.Println("Reloaded")
    }
  }()
}
</pre>

<p>Like I said, not hard but at least a little neat.</p>
