<p>Our lives plancked<br />
against time's flow:<br />
a measurement all must forgo.<p>

<p>For hopelessness awaits those<br />
who insist they exist<br />
beyond time's savage blow.<p>

<p>No memory can persist,<br />
no biology resist.<br />
In eternal passage, our fate<br />
is erased.<p>

<p>Despite insignificance<br />
when met with vastness,<br />
all life is miraculous.<br />
Beautiful uniqueness.</p>

<p>Accept the reality<br />
of tomorrow's decay.<br />
Abandon your hope for<br />
meaningful longevity.<br />

<p>Your gift is today.<br />
Your gift is today.</p>
