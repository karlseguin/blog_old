<p>One of the things you're going to run into when you first use <a href="http://nim-lang.org/">nim</a>, is that it lacks interfaces. As far as I'm concerned, that's a big limitation. However, there is a pattern available to us, which, as far as I can tell, is the "nim way."</p>

<p>The trick is to use a tuple of procs. Let's look at an example. First, we'll create our "interface":</p>

<pre data-language="python">
type
  IFileSource = tuple[
    read: proc(path: string): string
  ]
</pre>

<p>The above creates a new type, <code>IFileSource</code> which is a tuple containing a single key, <code>read</code>. <code>read</code> references a procedure which takes a path to a file (as a string) and returns the file's contents (also as a string).</p>

<p>From the execution point of view, this behaves just like an interface. We can create a procedure which takes an <code>IFileSource</code> and call its <code>read</code> method:</p>

<pre data-language="python">
proc process(fs: IFileSource) =
  let config = fs.read("config")
  ...
</pre>

<p>Hopefully, every thing is clear. Next, let's create an implementation which reads from the local file system:</p>

<pre data-language="python">
from os import nil

type
  LocalFileSource = object
    root: string

proc read(fs: LocalFileSource, file: string): string =
  return readFile(os.joinPath(root, file))
</pre>

<p>All that's left is to associate our implementation with our interface. The little mental barrier you need to tear down is that this is an explicit / manual process. By that, I mean we need to create a procedure that converts one to the other:</p>

<pre data-language="python">
proc toFileSource(fs: LocalFileSource): IFileSource =
  return (
    read: proc(file: string): string = fs.read(file)
  )
</pre>

<p>To use it, we'd do:</p>

<pre data-language="python">
let fs = LocalFileSource(root: "./data/")
process(fs.toFileSource())
</pre>

<p>For simple interfaces like this one, we can [arguably] simplify the code by replacing our <code>LocalFileSource</code> with a closure:<p>

<pre data-language="python">
proc localFileStore(root: string): IFileSource =
  return (
    read: proc(file: string): string =
      readFile(os.joinPath(root, file))
  )

process(localFileStore("./data/"))
</pre>

<p>I'll confess that it took me a few minutes of staring at the example I found before understanding it. But it's quickly become second nature. Having said that, I've seen a couple comments suggesting that Go-like interfaces (easily one of Go's best features) could be added in the future. That would be nice.</p>
