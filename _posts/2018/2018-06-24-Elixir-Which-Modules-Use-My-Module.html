<p>In Elixir, getting a list of modules that <code>use</code> a specific module is trickier than you'd think. It's caused me, and others, some grief.</p>

<p>The naive approach is to mark the module (say, with a special function):</p>

<pre><code class=elixir>defmacro __using__(_opts) do
  quote location: :keep do
    def __my_module(), do: :ok
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>Then  iterate through the modules with something like <code>:code.all_loaded/0</code> and look for our special function. But in Elixir, modules are lazily loaded and, there's a good chance that at the time you call <code>:code.all_loaded/0</code> the modules that you're looking for haven't been loaded it.</p>

<p>Idiomatically, I haven't found a great solution to this problem. The best seems to be to explicit pass the list of modules, either via configuration or as an argument to to a process. But this highlights a major pain point in Elixir: requiring a deep hierarchy of dependencies to be configured at the root app. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U7cLUygMeI">Dave Thomas spoke about this problem</a>, as well as others, at EMPEX.</p>

<p>At one point, we got pretty desperate to make this type of auto discovery work, and had our <code>__using__</code> write the caller's name to a DETS file, which could then be read at runtime. It worked, but it was ugly.</p>

<p>More recently, I came up with a &lt;airquote&gt;better&lt;/airquote&gt; solution.<p>

<p>First, we'll use <code>:application.loaded_applications/0</code> to get all the applications, then <code>:application.get_key/2</code> to get all the application's modules (which gives us all the names, even if they aren't loaded):</p>

<pre><code class=elixir>applications = :application.loaded_applications()
modules = Enum.reduce(applications, [], fn {app, _desc, _version}, acc ->
  {:ok, modules} = :application.get_key(app, :modules)
  # TODO
end)</code></pre>

<p>Now, if we wanted to, we could just iterate through <code>modules</code> and call <code>Code.ensure_loaded</code> and look for our special function. This essentially circumvents Elixir's lazily loading:</p>

<pre><code class=elixir>Enum.reduce(modules, acc, fn module, acc ->
  Code.ensure_loaded(module)
  # Does this module export our special __prepared_statements/0 function?
  case Keyword.get(module.__info__(:functions), :__prepared_statements) do
    nil -> acc
    0 -> [module | acc] # yes, it does, add it to the list
  end
end)</code></pre>

<p>It would be nice if we could make this more surgical and minimize the amount of modules we have to force load. This part is a little ugly, but it isn't too bad. What I do is add a special module to the app/libary.. Only if this module is present are the modules loaded and probed.</p>

<pre><code class=elixir>applications = :application.loaded_applications()
state = Enum.reduce(applications, [], fn {app, _desc, _version}, acc ->
  {:ok, modules} = :application.get_key(app, :modules)

  auto_registry? = Enum.any?(modules, fn m ->
    String.starts_with?(to_string(m), "Elixir.Special.Registry.Auto.")
  end)

  case auto_registry? do
    false -> acc
    true -> scan_app(modules, acc) # same code as above
  end
end)</code></pre>

<p>To make this work, you just need to drop an empty module in the app/library you want scanned. I use a macro to create this:</p>

<pre><code class=elixir>defmacro auto_discover() do
  module = Module.concat(Special.Registry.Auto, __CALLER__.module)
  quote do
    defmodule unquote(module) do
    end
  end
end</code></pre>

<p>Since I've seen this question asked a number of times, I hope this post will prove helpful. I also hope that future versions of Elixir address this problem.</p>
