<p>Growing older and older,<br>
my friend.<br>
My life will soon reach<br>
its end.</p>

<p>I've grown tired of hope<br>
turned to dust.<br>
Feel nothing but hate, fear<br>
and lust.</p>

<p>Dreams were faded by time.<br>
Just punishment for many crimes.<br>
The shadow that lies within,<br>
a testament to many sins.</p>

<p>Another life I could live,<br>
but no change would that give<br>
for a weakness in my spirit<br>
leads to lives lived in limits.</p>

<p>Alone in my bed.<br>
Not death that i dread<br>
I die in my house,<br>
with naught but a mouse.</p>

<p>Abandoned my sister,<br>
my nephew, a stranger.<br>
A crime now long past,<br>
yet never called me crass.</p>

<p>Two parents are lucky,<br>
they died, I was forty<br>
and never they saw<br>
my heart's dark claw.</p>

<p>No tombstone for me,<br>
more loved as a tree.<br>
No epitaph stands<br>
to witness my lands.</p>

<p>There's nothing to mourn<br>
'cept the day I was born;<br>
and nothing to say<br>
for the price that we pay.</p>
