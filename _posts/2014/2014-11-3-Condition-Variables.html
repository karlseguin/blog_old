<p>Condition variables let you block until a condition is met. For example, let's say that we're writing a little TCP server that can have up to MAX_CLIENTS connected. We might start with:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
import (
  "net"
  "sync"
)

type Server struct {
  sync.Mutex
  clients int

}

func (s *Server) Listen(address string) {
  l, err := net.Listen("tcp", address)
  if err != nil {
    panic(err)
  }
  defer l.Close()
  for {
    conn, err := l.Accept()
    if err != nil {
      //to do log this
      continue
    }
    s.Lock()
    s.clients++
    s.Unlock()
    go s.handleClient(conn)
  }
}

func (s *Server) handleClient(conn net.Conn) {
  defer s.disconnected()
  for {
     // ...
  }
}

func (s *Server) disconnected() {
  s.Lock()
  s.clients--
  s.Unlock()
}
</pre>

<p>One way to limit the total number of clients would be to check the value of <code>s.clients</code> within a loop:</p>


<pre data-language=go>
  for {
    s.Lock()
    for s.clients == MAX_CLIENTS {
      s.Unlock()
      time.Sleep(time.Second)
      s.Lock()
    }
    s.Unlock()
    conn, err := l.Accept()
    ...
  }
</pre>

<p>A more elegant solution is to use a condition variable. Condition variables provide a simple mechanism which our goroutines can use to signal a change to <code>s.clients</code>. First, we define the condition variable:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
import (
  "net"
  "sync"
  "sync/atomic"
)

type Server struct {
  clients uint64
  cond    *sync.Cond
}
</pre>

<p>Condition variable are made up of their own mutex. To iniate one, we'd do:<p>

<pre data-language=go>
s := &Server{
  cond: &sync.Cond{L: &sync.Mutex{}},
}
</pre>

<p>Next, instead of the above <code>for</code> spin, we can <code>Wait</code> for a signal:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
  for {
    s.cond.L.Lock()
    for s.listeners == MAX_CLIENTS {
      s.cond.Wait()
    }
    s.cond.L.Unlock()
    conn, err := l.Accept()
    ...
  }
</pre>

<p>And we change our <code>disconnected</code> method:</p>

<pre data-language=go>
func (s *Server) disconnected() {
  s.cond.L.Lock()
  s.clients--
  s.cond.L.Unlock()
  s.cond.Signal()
}
</pre>

<p>There are a couple interesting things in the above code. First of all, notice the locking and unlocking around the call to <code>Wait</code>. It might seem like we're locking for a very long time. But <code>Wait</code> unlocks <code>L</code> on entry and relocks <code>L</code> on exit. This results in much cleaner code -- you lock and unlock normally, without being locked while you wait.</p>

<p>Also, notice that we're still checking our condition inside of a loop. This is because the state of <code>s.clients</code> could be changed by a different goroutine between the time that the signal is sent and our code exiting <code>Wait</code>. (In this specific example, when the blocked goroutine is also the only one that can increment <code>s.clients</code>, the for loop is unecessary. But I wanted to show the for loop example anyways because it's more complete and more common).</p>
