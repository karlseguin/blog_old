<p>Up amongst the sky,<br>
I saw beauty for a mile.<br>
Then she sat across the aisle<br>
and my world became her smile.</p>

<p>It's nice to be reminded<br>
of colours bold and vivid.<br>
It's strange to feel alive,<br>
with heart pounding. Hope, it thrives</p>

<p>There's laughter to my left,<br>
this angel does not rest.<br>
A chorus of such artistry.<br>
A universal sobriety.</p>
