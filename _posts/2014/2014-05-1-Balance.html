<p>I murdered a boy last night<br>
for his crime of being out of sight.<br>
Was going to meet friends for supper<br>
and wanted his last quarter.</p>

<p>His mother will die<br>
unable to pay the bribes.<br>
His nephew will eat<br>
on the morality of men gone weak.</p>

<p>I killed a woman today,<br>
the price of her night being my day.<br>
I needed a new phone;<br>
they treated her line a drone.</p>

<p>Her widow cannot see.<br>
Wrong place. Wrong time. McCarthy.<br>
Now who will help him live?<br>
Fuck him, what does he have to give?</p>

<p>I'll starve a baby tomorrow.<br>
I like looking like a marshmallow.<br>
We'll stuf our faces with barbecue<br>
while his mother feeds him residue.</p>

<p>The family is better off!<br>
Can't these people control themselves?!<br>
He might have had a future<br>
had he be willing to kill another.</p>
