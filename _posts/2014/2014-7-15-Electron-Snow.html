<p>Wall's that glow<br>
of electron snow<br>
shield the sightless<br>
from heaven's brightness.<br>

<p>Our crystal addiction<br>
overburden's our vision.<br>
It limits perception<br>
to a world of hallucinations.<br>

<p>So numbed from this therapy<br>
goes unnoticed a transformation:<br>
senses atrophy<br>
and we lose our gustation.<br>

<p>The sweetness of life<br>
redefined by a frame.<br>
Alas hooked on cane<br>
else we'd envy Lot's wife.<br>

<p>For bonds that glow<br>
forty two minutes slow<br>
turns the heart<br>
from the beauty of dark.<br>

<p>Dreams for the waking<br>
is like wine for a child:<br>
a sip is mild,<br>
any more ends in bile.<br>

<p>Escaping the trials,<br>
we're locked in a prison.<br>
Abandon denials<br>
and cherish the schism.<br>
