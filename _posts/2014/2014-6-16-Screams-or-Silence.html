<p>Are a thousands screams<br>
better than silence?<br>
What of fascist regimes<br>
versus an empty canvas?</p>

<p>Is all creation beautiful<br>
be it man-made or natural?<br>
Should we take pride in our progress<br>
regardless of all duress?</p>

<p>Does art still inspire<br>
when painted shades of red?<br>
Do we still aspire<br>
thanks to the sound of children's dread?</p>

<p>Does one child's laughter<br>
negate another's hunger?<br>
Does the lion's vigor<br>
dull the poacher's trigger?</p>

<p>If the answer is unpleasant;<br>
Our legacy: degrees of torment.<br>
If the answer doesn't matter<br>
for life <em>was</em> born; peace torn asunder.</p>

<p>Then maybe it is treason<br>
to not feel hope and reason<br>
that progress is miraculous<br>
and harmony will come through vigilance.</p>

<p>Maybe 'tis no sin<br>
to be moved by a violin,<br>
enjoy friends and family<br>
and be touched by Kenndy's beauty.</p>

<p>Maybe our simplest poetry<br>
to our greatest symphony<br>
stands as testament<br>
to this experiment.</p>

<p>This opinion<br>
is easy to share in.<br>
A great burden<br>
our sins at Dresden<br>
A man can lose his sanity<br>
acknowledging his fathered calamity.</p>

<p>But this is not our reality<br>
There's no excuse for poverty.<br>
Suffering is born from indifference,<br>
selfishness and willful ignorance.</p>

<p>We can't excuse a crime<br>
repeated many times.<br>
We call ourrselves wights.<br>
Our victims without rights.</p>

<p>We cannot speak of beauty<br>
while failing in our duty<br>
to defend every life,<br>
from agonizing strife.</p>

<p>Our failures are not minor.</p>

<p>The suffering we've caused.<br>
The murders without pause.<br>
What little we've achieved,<br>
shadowed by misdeeds.</p>

<p>It leaves one without doubt<br>
despite the frenzied shouts<br>
that inorganic vapidness<br>
is a cruelty of different greatness.</p>

<p>Yet our absolute indifference<br>
for the grief rooted in our selfishness<br>
leads to one conclusion:<br>
we're nothing but pollution.</p>
