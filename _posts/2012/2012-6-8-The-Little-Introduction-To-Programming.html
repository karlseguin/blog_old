<p>I'm happy to release a new free book: <a href="http://codingintro.com/">The Little Introduction To Programming</a>.</p>

<p>It's different than my other books, largely because of the broad topic and different audience. It's as much an experience for me as anything else. But I hope it proves helpful. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-introduction-to-programming">on github</a>, with the main content being in <code>view/chapters</code>. Chapter 3 is the reason this is a website rather than an actual book.</p>
